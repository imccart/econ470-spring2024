    "text": "Course materials\n\nWhere to go\nThe best place for information on the class is our class website, here. I use the website as an easier way for you to access course materials, including notes/slides, a detailed schedule, and assignments. I’ll also use Canvas to distribute any papers or specific readings that aren’t available publicly, as well as post information that I don’t want public like virtual meeting passwords (if necessary) and grades.\n\n\nReadings\nThere is no required textbook for this class, but there are several books that I recommend for additional information and examples. The first is not free but is still very good:\n\nAngrist and Pischke (2009)\n\nThe following are also excellent resources, with the added bonus of having freely available versions of these texts online. Here are links to the free online versions:\n\nR for Data Science\nCausal Inference: The Mixtape\nThe Effect: An Introduction to Research Design and Causality\n\n\n\nStatistics software\nI’ll use R for my work and in all my answer keys and examples. I encourage you to use R as well, since that will be the language for which I can help you the most with any questions. That said, if you can answer all of the questions correctly with another software, feel free to do so. I am well-versed in Stata but less so in Python. If you choose to use Python (not a bad choice given its popularity), then I can certainly help with general questions and concepts, but I will be less helpful with any syntax issues.\n\n\nAccessing data\nFor all assignments and in-class activities, the necessary raw data will be available in our class OneDrive folder. For transparency, I will also point you to other GitHub repositories where available. We’ll spend some time on Git and GitHub at the beginning of the class, so don’t get too worried if this is new to you. If you’re new to Git or GitHub and want to understand some of that better, take a look at Grant McDermott’s notes on Data Science for Economists as well as Jenny Bryan’s online reference book, Happy Git and GitHub with R.\n\n\nLogistics\nFor day-to-day communication and announcements, I’ll use Canvas. Please be sure you’ve set up Canvas alerts so that you see all of these announcements in a timely manner."

    "text": "Course policies\nBe nice. Be honest. Don’t cheat.\nVarious policies for this course are described below. Basically, let’s all work to be good citizens and take seriously our various roles as a student, teacher, friend, colleague, human, etc.\n\nClass meetings\nAll regular class meetings will take place in Rich, 211 on Mondays and Wednesdays from 10:00am to 11:15am.\n\n\nOffice hours\nMy designated office hours will be on Monday and Wednesday from 1:30 to 2:30pm in R. Rollins, R432. I’m also available outside of these times. I just ask that you schedule an appointment in advance. Make an appointment with me here.\nWhile we call these “office hours” they really should be “student hours”. These are set times dedicated to all of you. This means that I will be in my office waiting for you to come by with whatever questions you have. Take a look at this video for a more interesting presentation of what office hours really are and why you should come!\n\n\nFor any questions that you don’t think need a meeting, you can always reach out to me through email. I do my best to respond within 24 hours to all emails.\n\n\nTurning things in\nAll assignments should be submitted as PDFs in GradeScope, along with a link to a GitHub repository.\n\n\nAcademic integrity\nThe Honor Code is in effect throughout the semester. By taking this course, you affirm that it is a violation of the code to cheat on exams, to plagiarize, to deviate from the teacher’s instructions about collaboration on work that is submitted for grades, to give false information to a faculty member, and to undertake any other form of academic misconduct. You agree that the instructor is entitled to move you to another seat during examinations, without explanation. You also affirm that if you witness others violating the code you have a duty to report them to the honor council. Students who violate the Honor Code may be subject to a written mark on their record, failure of the course, suspension, permanent dismissal, or a combination of these and other sanctions. The Honor Code may be reviewed here.\n\n\nChatGPT\nIn this course, students are encouraged to leverage the capabilities of ChatGPT and related AI software for academic exploration and assistance. However, it is essential to uphold the principles of academic integrity. While you are free to seek guidance from ChatGPT, the final submissions of all assignments and assessments must reflect your individual understanding and expression. Any instance of verbatim or substantially unaltered content from ChatGPT or other external sources (including your own classmates) will be considered plagiarism and subject to our policies on academic integrity (see above). The goal is to foster critical thinking and creativity while utilizing the tool responsibly. If you have any questions about the appropriate use of ChatGPT or related software, please ask me.\n\n\nAccessibility services\nIf you anticipate issues related to the format or requirements of this course, please meet with me. I would like us to discuss ways to ensure your full participation in the course. If you determine that accommodations are necessary, you may register with Accessibility Services at (404)727-9877 or via e-mail at accessibility@emory.edu. To register with OAS, students must self identify and initiate contact with the OAS office.\n\n\nAbsence policy\nMissing 25% or more of class meetings will result in automatic failure of a course. In other words, students absent seven (7) or more times, in a course that meets twice a week, will receive a grade of “F” for the course. Absences include trips, appointments, interviews, conferences, illness, injury, as well as simply not showing up. Religious observances, school business, and major illness will be considered; however, notify me in advance of any planned absences and submit your assignment prior to the event. After any absence, it is your responsibility to find out what material, assignments, or announcements you missed.\n\n\nLauren’s Promise\nI will listen and believe you if someone is threatening you.\nLauren McCluskey, a 21-year-old honors student athlete, was murdered on October 22, 2018 by a man she briefly dated on the University of Utah campus. We must all take action to ensure that this never happens again.\nIf you are in immediate danger, call 911 or Emory police (404-727-6111).\nAny form of sexual harassment or violence will not be excused or tolerated at Emory. If you are experiencing sexual assault, domestic violence, or stalking, please report it to me or directly to Emory’s Office of Respect (470-270-5360)."

I’ll also include all of our class worksheets on this resources page, so that they are all accessible in one place. Finally, this is where I’ll house any exam review sheets or similar supplemental material throughout the semester.\nBelow is a short list of additional resources and links that I will reference at different points throughout the semester:\n\nHow to read an academic article. We will review and discuss a few academic articles throughout the semester, and you will be asked to do this independently as part of your mid-term exam and your final project.\nSome resources for honing your data analysis skills in R:\n\nR for Data Science by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. This is the go-to resource for starting to work with R. Highly recommended, free, and informative.\nR Language Basics by Grant McDermott\nData cleaning and wrangling in R by Grant McDermott"

You can use Word and “print” to PDF, but I also encourage you to use Overleaf, which will help you to easily create PDFs and is much better for writing math-oriented documents. Overleaf is also fully cloud-based, and as an Emory student, you have full access to Overleaf Professional.\nThe only requirements for your submissions are: 1) they are submitted as PDFs; and 2) your answers are legible and organized. Please DO NOT write tiny answers in margins of papers, scan as PDF, and submit. I will not grade submissions like this, and the assignments will be considered late until a legible submission is uploaded. When you submit through GradeScope, you will also have to indicate which parts of your PDF align with which questions. Please be sure to do this correctly. Failure to do so will be treated as a late assignment until a properly aligned submission is uploaded.\nEach homework assignment is worth 60 points toward your final grade, consisting of 20 individual parts (think 4 or 5 questions each with 4 or 5 individual components). You should expect each part of each question to be worth 3 points. Each part will be graded as follows:\n\n3 points: Correct answer\n2 points: Good try and close, but with minor mistakes\n1 point: Incomplete work but an attempt nonetheless\n0 points: No work toward the answer (e.g., completely blank or some initial equation written/copied without any attempt to solve)\n\nAll of the homework assignments have both a “theoretical” section and an “empirical” section. The empirical work is intended to meet two requirements: 1) it must be accessible and achievable for someone without a background in data analysis or statistics; and 2) it must involve real-world data. These two objectives are somewhat conflicting, but I’ve done my best to pre-clean the data so that things are simple on your end.\nThe empirical part of the assignments can be completed in any data software, including Excel. I also provide the data in R format if you’re familiar with that language. If you’d like a refresher on R or would like to give it a shot from scratch, take a look at some of the links on our resources page."

Each check-in will ask questions about what you’ve learned in a given module so far, areas where you are confused, things that we do in class that you think are working, and things that we do in class that you think are not working. Completion of the check-in will provide 1 participation point.\nWe will also have regular in-class exercises. You can think of these as practice problems that we work on collectively as a class. Completing these exercises is also worth 1 participation point.\nAt the end of the semester, I will tally your participation points, and your final participation grade will be out of 10 possible participation points. We’ll have well over 10 total participation points available, so you have some margin for error here."
